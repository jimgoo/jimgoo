### Hi there 👋

I do open source research with LAION and Stability AI MedARC on reconstructing complex images from fMRI brain activity using diffusion models. 

<!-- I also help graphic design clients leverage diffusion models to generate new artwork (DreamBooth, textual inversion, prompt2prompt, pix2pix, ControlNet, etc). If this sounds of interest to you let's <a href="https://calendly.com/jimgoo/introductory-meeting">talk about your project</a>.
